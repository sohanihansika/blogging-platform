Hi!  
I am Sohani Hansika, an undergraduate at UCSC. I am currently an intern at Calcey Technology, exploring the world of software development and honing my skills in the tech industry.  
I have a passion for learning new technologies and solving challenging problems. In my free time, I enjoy reading tech blogs, contributing to open-source projects, and experimenting with creative coding ideas.  
Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and knowledge with others who are equally enthusiastic about technology and innovation. Stay tuned for more updates!
